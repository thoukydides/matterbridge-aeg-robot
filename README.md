<summary>Advanced Configuration Options</summary>

### Advanced Configuration

You can include additional settings in `matterbridge-aeg-robot.config.json` to customise the behaviour or enable special debug features:

| Key                     | Default            | Description
| ----------------------- | ------------------ | ---
| `name`<br>`type`<br>`version` | n/a          | These are managed by Matterbridge and do not need to be set manually.
| `apiKey`                | (no default)       | *API Key* obtained from the [Electrolux Group Developer Portal Dashboard](https://developer.electrolux.one/dashboard).
| `accessToken`           | (no default)       | *Access Token* obtained from the [Electrolux Group Developer Portal Dashboard](https://developer.electrolux.one/dashboard).
| `refreshToken`          | (no default)       | *Refresh Token* obtained from the [Electrolux Group Developer Portal Dashboard](https://developer.electrolux.one/dashboard).
| `pollIntervalSeconds`   | `30`               | The time in seconds between successive polls of the Electrolux Group API for each robot vacuum.
| `enableServerRvc`       | `true`             | When set to `false` all devices are exposed via a single Matter bridge. Setting it to `true` exposes each robot vacuum as a standalone Matter node using Matterbridge's `server` mode. This improves compatibility with Matter controllers such as the Apple Home app, but requires each robot vacuum to be paired individually.
| `blackList`             | `[]`               | If the list is not empty, then any robot vacuums with matching serial numbers will not be exposed as Matter devices.
| `whiteList`             | `[]`               | If `whiteList` is non-empty, then only robot vacuums with matching serial numbers will be considered. Devices are excluded if their serial number appears in `blackList`, regardless of inclusion in the `whiteList`.
| `debug`                 | `false`            | Sets the logger level for this plugin to *Debug*, overriding the global Matterbridge logger level setting.
| `debugFeatures`         | `[]`               | Miscellaneous options to control the information logged. None of these should be set unless you are investigating a compatibility issue or other problem.
| `unregisterOnShutdown`  | `false`            | Unregister all exposed devices on shutdown. This is used during development and testing; do not set it for normal use.

All supported robot vacuums associated with the account (those reporting a model name of `PUREi9`) will be added to Matterbridge. Unsupported appliances, such as air purifiers or RX8 robot vacuums, will be ignored. Exclude or include specific robot vacuums by listing their serial numbers in either the `blackList` or `whiteList`.

The API has a strict [rate limit](https://developer.electrolux.one/documentation/quotasAndRateLimits) of 5000 calls/day. The default value is 30 seconds, which results in 2880 calls/day for polling the state of a single appliance. If you have multiple robot vacuum cleaners in your account, or use the same API Key for other purposes, then scale the value appropriately: 60 seconds for two, 90 seconds for three, etc. More rapid polling is performed for a short period after a command has been sent to the robot vacuum; this is not configurable.

The supported `debugFeatures` are:

| Debug Feature          | Description
| ---------------------- | ---
| `Run API Tests`        | Performs a test of each idempotent Electrolux Group API endpoint (those just reading appliance information and status) once during plugin start-up. This is useful for detecting changes to the API implementation that may affect operation of this plugin.
| `Run Unsafe API Tests` | If `Run API Tests` is set then this additionally tests non-idempotent API endpoints (a `home` command is issued).
| `Log Endpoint Debug`   | Sets the `debug` flag to the Matterbridge/Matter.js endpoint implementation.
| `Log API Headers`      | Logs HTTP headers for each Electrolux Group API request. Rarely useful. (Requires *Debug* level logging.)
| `Log API Bodies`       | Logs message bodies for each Electrolux Group API request. Useful for diagnosing interoperability issues. (Requires *Debug* level logging.)
| `Log Appliance IDs`    | Product identifier and serial numbers are automatically redacted in the log by default. This setting causes these values to be logged verbatim.
| `Log Debug as Info`    | Redirect *Debug* level logging to *Info* level. This makes it visible in the Matterbridge frontend.

## Functionality

This plugin supports starting, pausing, stopping cleaning, and returning the vacuum to its charging dock. It also reports whether the vacuum is actively cleaning, the current power level, docked status, battery level, and any active errors.

Unfortunately, the Electrolux Group API only allows basic control of robot vacuums: **Play** (clean everywhere), **CustomPlay** (specified zones), **Stop**, **Pause**, and **Home**. It does not support any other control (such as selection of power modes or spot cleaning), so these cannot be controlled via this plugin.

<details>
<summary>Matter Clusters</summary>

This plugin exposes each robot vacuum as a Matter 1.4 device, supporting the following clusters:

### Bridged Device Basic Information Cluster

The **Bridged Device Basic Information** cluster provides information about the appliance:
* **HardwareVersion** / **HardwareVersionString**: The robot vacuum's hardware platform version.
* **ManufacturingDate**: The date that the robot vacuum cleaner was installed.
* **NodeLabel**: The name set by the user for the robot vacuum.
* **PartNumber**: The robot vacuum's PNC.
* **ProductAppearance**: The (approximate) colour and finish of the robot vacuum cleaner.
* **ProductLabel**: The robot vacuum's model family (if it can be identified from its PNC) and colour.
* **ProductName**: The robot vacuum's model name (if it can be identified from its PNC).
* **ProductURL**: URL for this plugin's homepage.
* **Reachable**: Indicates whether it is possible to communicate with the robot vacuum (plugin connected to the Electrolux Group API, robot vacuum connected to cloud servers, and robot vacuum enabled).
* **SerialNumber**: The robot vacuum's serial number.
* **SoftwareVersion** / **SoftwareVersionString**: The robot vacuum's firmware version.
* **UniqueId**: Opaque identifier used by Matter to identify the device (derived from a SHA-256 hash of the API `applianceId`).
* **VendorName**: The robot vacuum's manufacturer.

It also generates an event:
* **ReachableChanged**: Triggered when the **Reachable** attribute changes.

### Power Source Cluster

The **Power Source** cluster provides information about the battery and charging status:
* **Status**: Indicates whether the battery is currently being used.
* **BatChargeRemaining**: Indicates a coarse ranking of the battery charge level.
* **BatChargeLevel**: The battery charge level mapped to an indicative percentage.
* **BatChargeState**: The charging status:
    * *IsCharging* = Actively charging the battery.
    * *IsNotCharging* = Not currently charging. The battery is not fully charged.
    * *IsAtFullCharge* = The battery is fully charged.

The following mapping from values reported by the Electrolux Group API is used:

| Reported Battery Level | Status        | BatChargeRemaining | BatChargeLevel |
| ---------------------- | :-----------: | -----------------: | :------------: |
| `Dead`                 | *Unavailable* |               *0%* | *Critical*     |
| `Critical Low`         | *Active*      |              *20%* | *Critical*     |
| `Low`                  | *Active*      |              *40%* | *Warning*      |
| `Medium`               | *Active*      |              *60%* | *OK*           |
| `High`                 | *Active*      |              *80%* | *OK*           |
| `Fully Charged`        | *Active*      |             *100%* | *OK*           |

### RVC Run Mode Cluster

The **RVC Run Mode** cluster indicates whether the robot vacuum is cleaning:
* **CurrentMode**: 
    *Idle* = Indicates that the robot is not performing a cleaning operation.
    *Cleaning* = Indicates that the robot is actively cleaning (including paused, charging, or returning to the dock for charging, during a cleaning operation).

It supports a single command:
* **ChangeToMode**: Set **CurrentMode**:
    **Idle**: Attempt to stop a cleaning operation (but do not return to the dock).
    **Cleaning**: Attempt to start a new cleaning operation.

### RVC Clean Mode Cluster

The **RVC Clean Mode** cluster indicates the type of clean being performed:

| RX9.1          | RX9.2   | Full Clean | Full Clean ModeTags                               | Spot Clean  | Spot Clean ModeTags | Description                                                 |
| -------------- | ------- | :--------: | ------------------------------------------------- | :---------: | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ECO mode`     | `Quiet` | *Quiet*    | *Vacuum*, *Quiet*, *LowNoise*, *LowEnergy*, *Min* | *QuietSpot* | +*Quick*            | Lower energy consumption and quieter                        |
| n/a            | `Smart` | *Smart*    | *Vacuum*, *Auto*                                  | *SmartSpot* | +*Quick*            | Cleans quietly on hard surfaces, uses full power on carpets |
| `Not ECO mode` | `Power` | *Power*    | *Vacuum*, *Max*, *DeepClean*                      | *PowerSpot* | +*Quick*            | Optimal cleaning performance, higher energy consumption     |

Although the **ChangeToMode** command is defined, it will always return an error since the Electrolux API does not support selecting power modes or triggering spot cleans.

### RVC Operational State Cluster

The **RVC Operational State** cluster indicates the detailed robot vacuum status:
* **OperationalState**: Indicates the current state of the robot vacuum:

| Reported Status                                                                              | OperationalState                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `Charging` <br> `Pitstop`                                                                    | *Charging*                       |
| `Cleaning` <br> `SpotCleaning`                                                               | *Running*                        |
| `Error`                                                                                      | *Error*                          |
| `FirmwareUpgrade`                                                                            | *FirmwareUpgrade* (non-standard) |
| `ManualSteering`                                                                             | *ManualSteering* (non-standard)  |
| `PausedCleaning` <br> `PausedSpotCleaning` <br> `PausedReturn` <br> `PausedReturnForPitstop` | *Paused*                         |
| `Return` <br> `ReturnForPitstop`                                                             | *SeekingCharger*                 |
| `Sleeping` (off dock)                                                                        | *Stopped*                        |
| `Sleeping` (on dock)                                                                         | *Docked*                         |

* **OperationalError**: Indicates details of a non-transient problem with the robot vacuum when **OperationalState** is *Error*.

It supports three commands:
* **Pause**: Attempt to pause a cleaning operation (including returning to the charging dock).
* **Resume**: Attempt to resume cleaning, if currently paused.
* **GoHome**: Attempt to stop any cleaning operation in progress and initiate a return to the charging dock.

It also generates two events:
* **OperationCompletion**: Triggered when **RVC Run Mode** transitions from *Cleaning* to *Idle* indicating the end of a cleaning operation.
* **OperationalError**: Triggered when a new **OperationalError** occurs.

### Service Area Cluster

The **Service Area** cluster controls which zones will be cleaned and reports cleaning progress:
* **SupportedAreas**: List of all zones supported by the robot vacuum (excluding any avoid zones), across all interactive maps.
* **SupportedMaps**: List of interactive maps available on the robot vacuum.
* **SelectedAreas**: List of areas that will be cleaned the next time **RVC Run Mode** is changed from *Idle* to *Cleaning* using the **ChangeToMode** command. If this list is empty then a **Play** command will be issued to perform an *Everywhere* clean at the currently selected power level. Otherwise, a **CustomPlay** command will be issued to perform a *Zones* clean using the preferred power level configured for each zone.
* **CurrentArea**: The area currently being approached or cleaned during a *Zones* clean (ignoring any temporary pause for recharging) . This attribute is not available during an *Everywhere* clean.
* **Progress**: Cleaning progress for each area during a *Zones* clean. This attribute is not available during an *Everywhere* clean.

It supports a single command:
* **SelectAreas**: Sets **SelectedAreas** to the specified list of areas (removing any duplicates). If all **SupportedAreas** are specified then it is treated as an empty list to avoid problems with multiple maps.

## Compatibility

This plugin is expected to work with other AEG RX9 series and Electrolux Pure i9 variants, but has only been explicitly tested with a single AEG RX9.2 robot vacuum (model `RX9-2-4ANM`, PNC `900 277 479`, running firmware `43.23`).

Matter controllers vary in their support for Matter 1.4 RVCs. This plugin is only tested with Apple HomeKit and the Apple Home app.

| üöß Electrolux Group API ‚Äì DAM (Digital Appliance Model) |
| --- |
| *Electrolux have [announced](https://developer.electrolux.one/news) a transition of their API data model to a "Digital Appliance Model" (DAM). Based on the information currently available, this change is expected to break compatibility with this plugin (and other integrations using the Electrolux Group API); updates will be required to restore functionality.*<br>*It is not yet clear when (or even whether) legacy products such as the AEG RX9 / Electrolux Pure i9 robot vacuums will be migrated to this new model.*<br>*If you begin seeing log messages such as `Ignoring 1 incompatible appliance`, and the listed appliance type includes a `DAM_` prefix, please [open an issue](https://github.com/thoukydides/matterbridge-aeg-robot/issues/new/choose). Include a debug log captured using both the `Run API Tests` and `Log API Bodies` debug options.* |

<details>
<summary>Apple Home Limitations</summary>

### Robot Vacuums in Apple Home App

The Apple Home app, starting with iOS/iPadOS 18.4 and macOS Sequoia, has limited Matter support and exhibits multiple idiosyncrasies.

The Apple Home app expects each robot vacuum to be a standalone, individually-paired Matter node implementing a single endpoint. However, by default Matterbridge acts as a Matter bridge - either a single bridge node for all plugins (*bridge* mode), or a separate bridge node per plugin (*childbridge* mode) - with each plugin's device exposed as an additional child endpoint. The `enableServerRvc` configuration option enables use of Matterbridge's `server` mode for any robot vacuum devices, ensuring full compatibility with the Home app.

Other quirks in the Home app:
* **Delayed docking:** The *Send to Dock* button first sets **RVC Run Mode** to *Idle* (which maps to `stop` in the Electrolux Group API), followed by a **GoHome** command (`home`). The Electrolux Group API silently ignores commands sent too quickly in succession, so this plugin inserts a 5-second delay between them. This causes the robot vacuum to pause briefly before returning to the dock.
* **Incorrect RVC Clean Mode display:** The Home app displays ModeTag values (e.g. *Deep Clean*, *Quick*) rather than the advertised modes (*Smart*, *PowerSpot*, etc) reported by the robot vacuum. Worse, it only shows these when not cleaning, even though the Electrolux Group API only provides meaningful values during cleaning.
